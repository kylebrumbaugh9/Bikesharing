# Bikesharing

## Overview

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to look at the data for New York City's CitiBike program and determine whether or not we think that Des Moines, Iowa could have similar success with a bike-share program. Des Moines, Iowa and New York City, New York share a similar climate but New York City is about 40x larger than Des Moines. Des Moines should not expect similar numbers to New York City, but they should scale down the operation if they decide to implement the bike-share program.

### Technology used

I used Jupyter Notebook to update a .csv file and then utilized Tableau Public to import the data and build the visualizations. 

## Results

The first thing I looked at was the sheer number of rides in New York City. I also thought it was valuable to provide context to Des Moines here.

The next thing I looked into was the times of day that the bikes were used. Turns out, most bike rides begin during the 8am, 5pm, or 6pm hours.

Next, because 8am, 5pm, and 6pm are the classic commuting times, I wanted to take a look at the data a different way. This visualization definitely shows the majority of rides occur during the work week and occur during the classic commuting times

Then, I wanted to see if there was any difference in gender split. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, women held 50.05% of American jobs in 2019. However, it appears that men dominate the bike commute. It's obvious that some women bike to work but it appears that a greater percentage of men bike to work than women.

Getting back to the business of bike-sharing, it looks like the majority of New York Citibikes were ridden by subscribers, but most of the customers are riding the bikes on the weekend. Customers had the highest usage during the weekends, when people are more likely to take a leisurely, spur-of-the-moment bike-ride rather than using it for a commuting option. This makes sense given NYC's reputation, but I would expect a more laid-back town like Des Moines to have a higher percentage of casual bike-riders than NYC.

Most bike rides in NYC are for convenience. Most bike rides in NYC are less than 10 minutes. It would be interesting to see if Des Moines had a similar downtown spread or bike lines to make the city bikeable.

Because of the relatively large gender disparity in number of rides, I also wanted to see if there was any difference between the genders in length of ride. I saw very similar trends between the genders, meaning again, most rides are quick and for convenience rather than for exercise. 

## Summary

In general, I think bike-sharing is a popular option for people looking for a convenient and cheap way to get from point A to point B, as long as point A and point B are relatively close together. NYC was a good city to look at simply due to the sheer number of rides and the availability of the data. NYC citizens take a lot of bike rides and a lot of those bike rides appear to help them get to and from work, during the month of August. 

I think one of the next things we should look into is the city spread of Des Moines. I want to see if there are a lot of businesses in Des Moines that would mean a higher concentration of working people downtown. It appears people are using these bikes to commute in NYC so I would expect similar results in Des Moines if there are a proportionate number of businesses/jobs. I think we'd then need to compare this to the number of residences within biking distance (<10 minutes). This will tell us if Des Moines could expect a relatively large number of subscribers in order to build their client-base.

I think the next thing we need to look into at that point is the number of people in Des Moines that are out and about on the weekends. NYC has a large tourist population and I think that may be contributing to the increase in "customer" usage on the weekends. People are looking for a convenient way to get around the city without having to walk too far so I'd be interested in seeing the amount of foot traffic in downtown Des Moines.

Lastly, I think we should look into the weather in Des Moines and NYC. I'm thinking that Des Moines is a little colder on average than NYC and that may dissuade people from biking or at least limit the times of year where biking is available. If the city is going to invest in biking, we'd want to make sure that biking is an appropriate activity to make this cost effective.
